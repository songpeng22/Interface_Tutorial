this example comes from course:
Tutorial 7 : Creating ActiveX COM Controls using VC++ MFC and ATL
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyDkyY1WBPw&t=7s

plus:
I do not add MFC support and autosize option here, and also works.
plus 2:
this example used ATL Control as ActiveX, can be called by VB project, but previous example used Simple object can not be called by VB project.
